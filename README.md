# Loan Approval Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of loan approval based on applicants' financial and demographic data. The goal is to assist financial institutions in making informed loan approval decisions using machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Model interpretability and visualization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes:

- **Applicant Income**
- **Credit History**
- **Loan Amount**
- **Property Area**
- **Employment Status**
- **Other Financial Indicators**

## 💊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best model provides accurate predictions for loan approval likelihood.
